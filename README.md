# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Cookie-Clicker-in-React: Assignment Reflection

Met Requirements and Achieved Goals

- State Management: Implemented state variables using `useState` to track the number of cookies and cookies per second.
- Timer Functionality: Set up a timer using `useEffect` to increment the number of cookies by the cookies per second value.
- Store Functionality: Created an array of objects representing items available for purchase in the store, allowing users to buy upgrades that increase cookies per second.
- Local Storage: Implemented local storage to persist cookies and cookies per second values between page refreshes, fulfilling the stretch goal.

Unachieved Goals

All specified requirements and goals were successfully achieved.

Difficulties Encountered

No significant difficulties were encountered during the completion of this assignment. However, ensuring proper synchronization between state updates and local storage values required careful consideration to avoid potential issues with data consistency.
